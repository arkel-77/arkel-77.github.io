# personal-website-arkel-77

This is the repository for my personal website, most of which I wrote as part of
a project for my Foundations of Software Engineering class at Texas A&M.

All the files that are deployed to [the site](arkel-77.github.io) are located in
`public/`.

I'm currently working to set up separate pages for a couple of my personal
projects, which can hopefully be embedded in the future.
