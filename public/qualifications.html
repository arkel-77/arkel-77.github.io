              As a computer engineering major at Texas A&M, I have a strong
              academic foundation and comprehensive leadership experience
              through the Corps of Cadets. My extensive involvement in tutoring
              for the General O.R. Simpson Corps Honor Society showcases a
              dedication to excellence and service, and my involvement as a
              staff member displays my willingness to step up when necessary. I
              have a proven track record as a Robotics Engineer Intern at
              Leidos, where I've successfully completed projects and designed
              solutions that improved product quality and productivity.

            <h2>Areas of Interest</h2>
            <p>
              My main areas of technical focus are robotics, artificial
              intelligence, and computer graphics.

              Robotics has captivated me since my grandpa gave me a LEGO
              Mindstorms set when I was 5 years old. I built several different
              robots with it while I had the flu, and ever since, I've been
              hooked. In elementary school, I participated in
              <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll"
                >FIRST Lego League</a
              >, and then in middle school I helped as much as I could with my
              mom's
              <a href="http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FRC</a> team
              (two steps up from FLL), despite being too young to be an official
              member. When I finally made it to high school, not only did I
              finally join the team as a full member, but I also joined a
              <a href="https://www.bestrobotics.org/site/">BEST Robotics</a>
              team, eventually becoming team captain.

              AI is more of a recent interest because of the special kinds of
              problems that can be solved with AI. Just as I was getting
              interested, ChatGPT came out and the wave of AI generated content
              and AI-powered applications hit. My first internship at
              <a href="https://www.leidos.com">Leidos</a> helped me to get up to
              speed on AI just in time for the boom.

              Engineering, especially programming, is such a purely logical,
              thinking exercise that any opportunity to embrace the other side
              of my brain and do a little art is welcome. Maybe that's why I
              enjoy graphics programming so much: it's all about setting out
              with an artistic vision and making that happen through creative
              application of mathematics. In many ways, it's a perfect blend of
              art and science.
