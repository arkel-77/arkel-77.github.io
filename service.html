                                Bella's Buddies brings Animal Assisted Therapy candidates into public school classrooms using teacher foster and student-involved training to enrich the learning environment.
                                After successfully completing the K9U program, canine graduates are donated to schools, veterans long-term care facilities and hospitals, and organizations that serve in low socionomic and at-risk communities.

                                I have volunteered with Bella's Buddies many times during my college career, along with the rest of my Corps outfit, <a href="https://stuactonline.tamu.edu/app/organization/profile/public/id/1415">Squadron Six</a>.
                                The entire outfit goes together for a full workday at their ranch once or twice per semester, doing odd jobs like painting sheds and washing dogs.
                                Additionally, I've volunteered to help handle the dogs at several locations, including one school that had recently undergone a tragedy.
