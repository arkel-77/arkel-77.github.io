                    <p>
                        As a computer engineering major at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu">Texas A&M</a>, I have a strong academic foundation and comprehensive leadership experience through the Corps of Cadets.
                        My extensive involvement in tutoring for the <a href="https://maroonlink.tamu.edu/organization/gorschs">General O.R. Simpson Corps Honor Society</a> showcases a dedication to excellence and service, and my involvement as a staff member displays my willingness to step up when necessary.
                        I have a proven track record as a Robotics Engineer Intern at <a href="https://www.leidos.com">Leidos</a>, where I've successfully completed projects and designed solutions that improved product quality and productivity.

                    <h3>Areas of Interest</h3>
                    <p>
                        My main areas of technical focus are robotics, artificial intelligence, and computer graphics.

                        Robotics has captivated me since my grandpa gave me a LEGO Mindstorms set when I was 5 years old.
                        I built several different robots with it while I had the flu, and ever since, I've been hooked.
                        In elementary school, I participated in <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll">FIRST Lego League</a>
                        , and then in middle school I helped as much as I could with my mom's <a href="http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FRC</a> team (two steps up from <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll">FLL</a>), despite being too young to be an official member.
                        When I finally made it to high school, not only did I finally join the team as a full member, but I also joined a <a href="https://www.bestrobotics.org/site/">BEST Robotics</a> team, eventually becoming team captain.

                        AI is more of a recent interest because of the special kinds of problems that can be solved with AI.
                        Just as I was getting interested, ChatGPT came out and the wave of AI generated content and AI-powered applications hit.
                        My first internship at <a href="https://www.leidos.com">Leidos</a> was perfectly timed for me to learn my way around AI just in time for the demand spike.

                        Engineering, especially programming, is such a purely logical, thinking exercise that any opportunity to embrace the other side of my brain and do a little art is welcome.
                        Maybe that's why I enjoy graphics programming so much: it's all about setting out with an artistic vision and making that happen through creative application of mathematics.
                        In many ways, it's a perfect blend of art and science.
