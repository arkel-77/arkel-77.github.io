        <h1>The Hitchhiker's Guide to Computer Engineering</h1>
        <p>In the vast expanse of the digital universe, where bits and bytes frolic in the binary meadows, there lies a peculiar phenomenon known as Computer Engineering. Picture this: a fusion of logic gates and creativity, where hardware and software dance in perfect harmony.</p>
        <p>As Douglas Adams might say, computer engineers are the hitchhikers of the technological galaxy, armed with their trusty towel (and maybe a soldering iron). Navigating through the whimsical world of circuits and code, they embark on a journey to unravel the mysteries of the digital cosmos.</p>
        <p>Why is computer engineering so cool, you ask? Well, it's not just about ones and zeros; it's about turning imagination into reality. It's the magic of making electrons perform a symphony of computations, bringing dreams to life through lines of code. The coolest part? The answer is 42!</p>

        <h2>Prompt for AI-Generated Page:</h2>
        <p>My name is Alex Kelley. I'm a computer engineering major at Texas A&M University.</p>
        <p>I'm creating a personal website, and I've created most of the pages (including the landing page), but I'm still in need of an AI-generated page. Please write it for me in HTML/CSS.</p>
        <p>I'd like this page to have an 80's computer terminal aesthetic (light blue monospace text on a black background).</p>
        <p>This page should include navigation links to the following pages: Home (index.html), Portfolio (portfolio.html), Qualifications (qualifications.html), and Service (service.html). Alongside these links should be some way of showing which page is currently selected, that being AI-Generated (ai-generated.html).</p>
        <p>In one section, present a case for why computer engineering is so cool, framed as a story in the writing style of Douglas Adams.  Create another section that contains this prompt verbatim.</p>
